<TITLE>Comments on A simple output server</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
This simple example shows code that is the basis for some of the most powerful
and complex message passing programs.  The master/slave example is
particularly appropriate for irregular task decomposition, load balancing
tasks that take an unpredictable amount of time, and for handling irregular
data structures.
<P>
In the solution here, the server allows any process to send an ordered output
message.  An alternative approach is to allow only slave 0 to send a request
to perform ordered output.  Then the master can send a message to either slave
0 or to each slave, informing them that they can send the ordered output
message.  
<P>
You can implement this alternate approach by using the ring communication
within the slaves to indicate which slave can send an ordered message next.
