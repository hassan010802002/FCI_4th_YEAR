This directory contains a collection of example programs, in C and Fortran,
the demonstrate the use of MPI.  They are organized in such a way as
to simplify constructing HTML files to allow "side branches" to be
followed by the student.

This directory can also be extracted (with maint/maketar) and run with other
MPI implementations by putting maint/envs/<systemtype> in the path, and setting
the mpirun and mpicc scripts in that directory.

Special notes:
If you are generating log files, you need to get and build mpe (from
ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/mpi/misc/mpe.tar.gz ).  The mpicc script (in
mpiexmpl/maint/envs/<your system name>/mpicc will need to add the library
liblmpi.a to the link line when the option -mpilogs is selected.  See
mpiexmpl/maint/envs/sp2-ibm/mpicc for an example.

To run the programs, do
    make examples 
Some of the examples use more than 2 processors.  If there is a limit on the
number of available processors, set

MPIEXMPL_MAX_NP

to the number available.  Examples requiring more than that will not be run.

The most interesting sets for performance problem can be run with
cd src3
<edit the file runall to indicate your machine name (mach="name")>
runall

The output will be two .html files (runall.<name>.html and
runall.<name>.log.html) and a tar file (logs.tar).  

You can run specific sets with

cd src3
./runtests -base 
./runtests -base -logs

With the -logs switch, a collection of MPE alog files will be deposited in a
tar file.

Finally, the log files can be labeled as to their machine by adding the -mach=
option:

./runtests -base -logs -mach=sgimpi

The script src3/runall can be used to collect more extensive data.
It should be edited for the value of machname.
