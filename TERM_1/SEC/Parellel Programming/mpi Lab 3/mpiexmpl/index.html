<TITLE>MPI Tutorial Exercises</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

Welcome to the exercises for the MPI tutorial.  These exercises will introduce
you to the use of MPI routines by having you construct several programs.
You should have access to an MPI implementation before you start.
<P>
These exercises should be combined with another source of instructional 
material; they have been designed to accompany a collection of tutorial 
presentations developed by <A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~gropp">William Gropp</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/lusk">Ewing Lusk</A>.  
<P>
Each exercise consists of
<DL>
<DT> Assignment
<DD> This describes what your program should do

<DT> Output
<DD> Sample output that your program should generate

<DT> A Solution
<DD> A tested solution to the assignment.  You should look at this only when 
your solution is working or you are having trouble.

<DT> Comments
<DD> This contains some commentary on the assignment and the solution.
</DL>

In addition, an exercise may also provide
<DL>
<DT> Related exercises
<DD> These are variations on the assignment.  You should at least read these 
and look at the solutions and commentary.

<DT> Hints
<DD> Contains some suggestions if you are having trouble

<DT> Profile
<DD> A link to a Nupshot data file; this graphically displays the execution of
the solution.  See <A HREF="#nupshot_setup">Nupshot Setup</A> below.
</DL>

Finally, all exercises contain links to the MPI standard and an MPI Home Page, which you can use for additional information.
<P>
Throughout, references to MPI routines are linked to the 
<A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/index.html">MPICH manual pages</A>
for MPI.

<H2>Caveats</H2>
This tutorial is under construction.  It requires a browser that supports 
frames, and have only been tested with Netscape 2.02.
<P>
Comments are encouraged; please send 
them to <A HREF="mailto:gropp@mcs.anl.gov">gropp@mcs.anl.gov</A>.

<A NAME="nupshot_setup"><H2>Nupshot Setup</H2></A>
In order to have the <A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich">MPICH</A> 
program <CMD>nupshot</CMD> process the profile data files, it is necessary to 
configure your Web browser to process files with extension <CODE>alog</CODE>
with the nupshot program.  
<P>
Currently, nupshot is available only for Unix systems.  You may be able to 
use upshot (also distributed with MPICH) on systems that support tcl/tk.
This includes Windows, though we haven't tested it.  Let us know if you have 
success running upshot under windows.

<H3>Netscape version 2</H3>
For Netscape version 2 running under Unix, you can do this
by modifying two files.
<P>
First, check which files Netscape uses for the MIME configuration.
In Netscape, go to "Options", pick "General Preferences", and choose "Helpers".
Check your "Personal Types File" and "Personal Mailcap File".

To your "Personal Types File", add the lines
<PRE>
# Invoke nupshot on alog files
application/x-nupshot            alog
</PRE>

To your "Personal Mailcap File", add the lines
<PRE>
# Make sure that the path to nupshot is correct
application/x-nupshot; /usr/local/mpi/bin/nupshot %s
</PRE>

You may need to restart Netscape for these to take effect.
<P>
<H3>Netscape version 3</H3>
Go to "Options", pick "General Preferences", and choose "Helpers".
Select "New", set the description to
application/x-nupshot, the suffix to alog, and the application to 
"/usr/local/mpi/bin/nupshot %s" (use the correct path, of course).

<H3>Other Web Browsers</H3>
You'll need to check the documentation for your web browser.  The instructions
for Netscape version 2 and version 3 should help you determine what your 
browser needs.
