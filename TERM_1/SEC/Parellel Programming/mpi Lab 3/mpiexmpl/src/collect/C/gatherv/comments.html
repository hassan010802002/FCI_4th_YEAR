<TITLE>Comments on Collecting Data (with varying amounts from each process)</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
We could have used exact knowledge of the amount of data on each process (the
<CODE>lcnt</CODE> value in the solution) instead of using <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Gather.html#MPI_Gather">MPI_Gather</A> to
collect the values.  Using <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Gather.html#MPI_Gather">MPI_Gather</A>, however, is simple and allows us to
ensure that we are using the correct values.
