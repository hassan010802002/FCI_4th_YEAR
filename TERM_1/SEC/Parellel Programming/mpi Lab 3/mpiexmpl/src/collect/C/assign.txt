Once a parallel program computes a solution, it it often necessary to write
the solution out to disk or display it on the user's terminal.  This often
means collecting the data onto a single processor that handles performing the
output (since there are few parallel file systems around).  This exercise
shows one way in which this may be performed.

Take your <A HREF="../../jacobi/C/main.html" TARGET="mainwindow">Jacobi
iteration example</A> and modify it so that the computed solution is collected
onto process 0, which then writes the solution out (to standard output).  You
might want to write the results out in a form that can be used for display
with tools like gnuplot or matlab, but this is not required.

You may assume that process zero can store the entire solution.  Also, assume
that each process contributes exactly the same amount of data (see the related
problems for the general case).
