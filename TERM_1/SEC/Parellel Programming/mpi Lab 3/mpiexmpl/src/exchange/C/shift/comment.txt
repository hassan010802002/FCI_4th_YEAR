This example shows a common approach to sharing "ghost points", particularly
for regular arrays.  Some systems may also be able to optimize the
communications in this example.  Note also that this is deadlock "safe", since
by combining the send and receive operations, it is up to the MPI
implementation to ensure that both can complete.
