A common need is for one process to get data from the user, either by reading
from the terminal or command line arguments, and then to distribute this
information to all other processors.
<P>
Write a program that reads an integer value from the terminal and distributes
the value to all of the MPI processes.  Each process should print out its rank
and the value it received.  Values should be read until a negative integer
is given as input.  
<P>
You may find it helpful to include a <CODE>fflush( stdout );</CODE> after
the <CODE>printf</CODE> calls in your program.  Without this, output may not
appear when you expect it.
