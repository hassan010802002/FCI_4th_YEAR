Some MPI systems ensure that all processes have all command line arguments (it
is one reason that the <CODE>argc</CODE> and <CODE>argv</CODE> arguments to
MPI_Init are pointers) but this is not required by the standard.
<P>
Note that output from <CODE>printf</CODE> may not appear until a process
(begins to) exit; this is actually a feature of Unix.  You can use the
<CODE>fflush</CODE> function to force the <CODE>printf</CODE> routine to flush
output.
