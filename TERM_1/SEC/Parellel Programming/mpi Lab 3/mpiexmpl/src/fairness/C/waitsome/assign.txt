Write a program to provide fair reception of message from all sending
processes. Arrange the program to have all processes except process 0 send 100
messages to process 0.  Have process 0 print out the messages as it receives
them.  Use nonblocking receives and MPI_Waitsome.

Is the MPI implementation fair?
