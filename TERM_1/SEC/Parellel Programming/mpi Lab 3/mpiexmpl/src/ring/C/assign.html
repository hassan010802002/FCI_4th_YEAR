<TITLE>Sending in a ring (broadcast by ring)</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Write a program that takes data from process zero and sends it to all of the
other processes by sending it in a ring.  That is, process i should receive
the data and send it to process i+1, until the last process is reached.

Assume that the data consists of a single integer.  Process zero reads the
data from the user.
