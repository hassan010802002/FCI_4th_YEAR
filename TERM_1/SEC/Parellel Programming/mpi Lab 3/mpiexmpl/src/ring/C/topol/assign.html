<TITLE>Using topologies to find neighbors</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
In the ring example we assume that the "next" process is the one with rank one
greater than our rank.  That is, process i sends to process i + 1.  This may
not be the best choice of "next" process, particularly when using a
communicator other than MPI_COMM_WORLD.

MPI provides topology routines to find a good ordering of processes,
particularly for simple linear orderings such as needed here.  The assignment
is to replace the use of "rank+1" and "rank-1" (where rank refers to the rank
in MPI_COMM_WORLD of the calling process) with values computed using
