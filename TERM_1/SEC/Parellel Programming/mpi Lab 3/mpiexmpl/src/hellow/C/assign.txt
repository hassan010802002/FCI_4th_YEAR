Write a program that uses MPI and has each MPI process print
<PRE>
Hello world from process i of n
</PRE>
using the rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD for i and the size of MPI_COMM_WORLD for n.
You can assume that all processes support output for this example.
<P>
Note the order that the output appears in.  Depending on your MPI
implementation, characters from different lines may be intermixed.
A subsequent exercise (<A HREF=../../../src2/io/C/main.html>I/O
master/slaves</A>) will show how to order the output.
