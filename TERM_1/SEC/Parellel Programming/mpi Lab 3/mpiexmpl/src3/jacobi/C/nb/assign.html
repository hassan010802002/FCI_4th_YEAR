<TITLE>Jacobi Iteration - Nonblocking send/recv</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
This version uses nonblocking operations for both sending and receiving; 
primarily, this is to handle the buffering issues.  This case posts the
receives first, allowing eager delivery to often avoid copies (but without
guarenteeing that).
<P>
A separate example shows the use of nonblocking operations to express the
overlap of communication and computation.
