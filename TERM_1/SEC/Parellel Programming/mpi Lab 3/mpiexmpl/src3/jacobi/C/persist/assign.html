<TITLE>Jacobi Iteration - Persistent send/recv</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
This version uses nonblocking operations for both sending and receiving; 
primarily, this is to handle the buffering issues.  In order to increase the
efficiency, MPI persistent operations are used.
<P>
This is very similar to the simple nonblocking example.
