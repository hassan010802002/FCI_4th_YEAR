<TITLE>Comments on Benchmarking point to point performance with contention with MPI_Ssend</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Compare the results of this test to the basic pingpong test (with <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Ssend.html#MPI_Ssend">MPI_Ssend</A>).
On shared networks, you are likely to see performance that is very roughly
1/(size/2) of the performance of the basic pingpong test.  Multistage networks
will provide performance that degrades more slowly as the number of processors
increases; there may be steps indicating major changes in interconnection
(e.g., a system made up of 4 x 4 crossbars may show changes at 4, 16, 64,
etc. processors).
