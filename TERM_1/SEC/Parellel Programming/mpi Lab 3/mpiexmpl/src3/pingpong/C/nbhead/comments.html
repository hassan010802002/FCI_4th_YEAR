<TITLE>Comments on Benchmarking point to point performance with nonblocking operations, head-to-head</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Some systems can manage two-way exchanges of data between partners more
efficiently than they can send and receive with two different partners.
Other systems may suffer performance penalties when sending head-to-head.
<P>
Note that this example did not have both processes doing an <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Send.html#MPI_Send">MPI_Send</A> followed
by an <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Recv.html#MPI_Recv">MPI_Recv</A>.  Recall that <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Send.html#MPI_Send">MPI_Send</A> may block (depending on implementation)
until the matching receive begins.
