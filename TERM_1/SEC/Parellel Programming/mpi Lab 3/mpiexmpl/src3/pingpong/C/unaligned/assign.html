<TITLE>Benchmarking point to point performance with unaligned data</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Write a program to measure the time it takes to send 1, 2, 4, ..., 1M 
copies of various MPI C datatypes (such as MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_CHAR, and MPI_INT)
from one processor to another using <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Send.html#MPI_Send">MPI_Send</A> and <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Recv.html#MPI_Recv">MPI_Recv</A>.  Use the
same techniques as in the memcpy assignment to average out variations and
overhead in <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Wtime.html#MPI_Wtime">MPI_Wtime</A>.
As in the unaligned memcpy tests, make the send and receive buffers different
and well separated in memory.  Make them unaligned relative to each other, but
preserve the usual alignment rules that a object (probably) must start on an
address that is an integral multiple of its size.
<P>
Print the size, time, and rate in MB/sec for each test.
<P>
Make sure that both sender and reciever are ready when you begin the test.
The sample solution uses <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Sendrecv.html#MPI_Sendrecv">MPI_Sendrecv</A>, but other choices are possible.
