This simple test does not identify sudden changes in performance.  The program
<CODE>mpptest</CODE> in the MPICH distributions contains a more sophisticated
version of this exercise.  Compare this to the MPI_Send/MPI_Recv version.
<P>
One effect that this simple example does not take into account is the
behavior of the memory cache.  This can lead to an over-estimate of the
available performance.
