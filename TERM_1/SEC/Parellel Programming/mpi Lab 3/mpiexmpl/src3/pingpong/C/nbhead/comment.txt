Some systems can manage two-way exchanges of data between partners more
efficiently than they can send and receive with two different partners.
Other systems may suffer performance penalties when sending head-to-head.
<P>
Note that this example did not have both processes doing an MPI_Send followed
by an MPI_Recv.  Recall that MPI_Send may block (depending on implementation)
until the matching receive begins.
