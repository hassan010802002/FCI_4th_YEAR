<TITLE>Comments on Benchmarking point to point performance with contention</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Compare the results of this test to the basic pingpong test.  On shared
networks, you are likely to see performance that is very roughly 1/(size/2) of
the performance of the basic pingpong test.  Multistage networks will provide
performance that degrades more slowly as the number of processors increases;
there may be steps indicating major changes in interconnection (e.g., a system
made up of 4 x 4 crossbars may show changes at 4, 16, 64, etc. processors).
