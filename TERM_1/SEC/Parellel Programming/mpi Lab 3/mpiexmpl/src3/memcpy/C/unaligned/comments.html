<TITLE>Comments on Determining delivered memory performance with unaligned data</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
This test can give some surprising results for the larger memory sizes.  
Depending on the memory architecture, the requirement that the source and
destination be "well separated" can affect the performance of the memory
system.  On a Sparc 5, the unaligned tests had twice the asymptotic bandwidth
of the simple aligned tests.  Rates for smaller sizes were lower than in the
aligned case.
