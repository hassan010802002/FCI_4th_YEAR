This example shows how performance can be harmed by specifying excessive
synchronization.  

Form a grid of processors containing 4 rows and 3 columns.  Have each
processor send len (default of 2048) MPI_DOUBLE to the 4 neighboring
processors in the order down, right, up, left.  The grid of processors is NOT
periodic.  That is, the processors on the bottom row do not send down, the
processors in the rightmost column do not send right, etc.

Use MPI_Irecv to post receives for each of the four directions.  Use MPI_Send
to send in the order down, right, up, left.  Observe the time that each
MPI_Send takes.
