If the MPI implementation uses rendezvous with sender push and polls for 
MPI control information, a process that is ready to receive can end up waiting
until the sender completes a computation step before the transfer actually
begins.  If all of the processes are out-of-step with each other, this can
cascade, leading to delays proportional to the number of processes in the
worst case.
