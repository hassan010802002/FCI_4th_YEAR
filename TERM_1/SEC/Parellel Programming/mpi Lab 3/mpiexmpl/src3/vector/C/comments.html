<TITLE>Comments on Comparing the performance of MPI vector datatypes</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Compare the performance of these vector sends and receives with contiguous
data of the same size.  
<P>
Try different strides.  Compare large powers of two (like 4096) with slightly
different strides (like 4095).  Depending on the system (particularly the
memory/cache architecture) you may see very different performance.
<P>
The MPICH implementation and some others detect some kinds of vector datatypes
and optimize for them.  The Type_struct form (using the MPI_UB) is less likely
to be optimized.
