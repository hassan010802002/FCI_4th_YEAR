Write a program to measure the time it takes to perform an MPI_Barrier on 
MPI_COMM_WORLD.  Use the
same techniques as in the memcpy assignment to average out variations and
overhead in MPI_Wtime.
<P>
Print the size of MPI_COMM_WORLD and time for each test.
<P>
Make sure that both sender and reciever are ready when you begin the test.
<P>
How does the performance of MPI_Barrier vary with the size of MPI_COMM_WORLD?
