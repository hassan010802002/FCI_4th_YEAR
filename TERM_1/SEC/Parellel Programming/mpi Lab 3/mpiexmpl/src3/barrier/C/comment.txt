Systems which must use point-to-point communication for MPI_Barrier (by
exchanging zero-length messages) will probably display a log(p) behavior for
the cost of an MPI_Barrier.  Systems that can use either a special network or
shared memory may have faster barriers with different scaling.
<P>
Some of these optimizations (in particular, special networks) apply only to
MPI_COMM_WORLD or a communicator that contains the same processes as
MPI_COMM_WORLD.
