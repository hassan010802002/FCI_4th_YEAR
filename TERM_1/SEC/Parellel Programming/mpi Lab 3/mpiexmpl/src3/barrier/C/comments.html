<TITLE>Comments on Benchmarking collective barrier</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
Systems which must use point-to-point communication for <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Barrier.html#MPI_Barrier">MPI_Barrier</A> (by
exchanging zero-length messages) will probably display a log(p) behavior for
the cost of an <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Barrier.html#MPI_Barrier">MPI_Barrier</A>.  Systems that can use either a special network or
shared memory may have faster barriers with different scaling.
<P>
Some of these optimizations (in particular, special networks) apply only to
MPI_COMM_WORLD or a communicator that contains the same processes as
MPI_COMM_WORLD.
