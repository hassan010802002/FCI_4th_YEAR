Systems which must use point-to-point communication for <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Allreduce.html#MPI_Allreduce">MPI_Allreduce</A> 
will probably display a log(p) behavior for
the cost of an <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Allreduce.html#MPI_Allreduce">MPI_Allreduce</A>.  Systems that can use either a special network or
shared memory may have faster reductions with different scaling.
<P>
Some of these optimizations (in particular, special networks) apply only to
MPI_COMM_WORLD or a communicator that contains the same processes as
MPI_COMM_WORLD.
