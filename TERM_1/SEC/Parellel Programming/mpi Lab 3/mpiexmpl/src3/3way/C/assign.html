<TITLE>Exploring the cost of synchronization delays</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
In this example, 2 processes are communicating with a third.  Process 0 is
sending a long message to process 1 and process 2 is sending a relatively
short message to process 1 and then to process 0.  Arrange the code so that
process 1 has already posted an <A href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/www/www3/MPI_Irecv.html#MPI_Irecv">MPI_Irecv</A> for the message from process 2
before receiving the message from process 0, but also ensure that process 1
receives the long message from process 0 before receiving the message from
process 2.
<P>
This seemingly complex communication pattern mimics a pattern that can occur
in an application due to timing variations on each processor.  If the message
sent by process 2 to process 1 is short but long enough to require a
rendezvous protocol, there can be a sigificant delay before the short message
from process 2 is received by process 1, even though the receive for that
message is already available.  Explore the possibilities by considering
various lengths of messages.
<P>
The code for this assignment is relatively short but hard to describe in
words; feel free to look at the solution if you have trouble understanding the
description above.  A good way to look at this example is to use nupshot
logging (see the profiles).
<P>
Some MPI implementations will be relatively insensitive to the size of the
short message.  See the comments and profiles for an example of an
implementation that is sensitive.  
<P>
Think about how you might "trick" the MPI implementation that you use to delay
completing a send or a receive by having several processes involved.  How
would you test your hypothesis?
